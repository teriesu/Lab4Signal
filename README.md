# Object detection using machine vision 
________________________

This project was created by [**teriesu**](https://github.com/teriesu) and [**yepedraza**](https://github.com/yepedraza) to be presented into an university project. It controls a unity video game game that is not in this repo. 

## Camera calibration

To begin this project, the camera should be calibrated. This process needs differents images, taken by the project's camera. The photos are in [im_1](https://github.com/teriesu/Lab4Signal/tree/master/im_1) and [im_2](https://github.com/teriesu/Lab4Signal/tree/master/im_2). 
The calibration process is made two times, the first one using python, and the second one using matlab. But because of the few samples the results diverg.

This results are expressed in [**calibresult1**](https://github.com/teriesu/Lab4Signal/tree/master/calibresult1) and [**calibresult2**](https://github.com/teriesu/Lab4Signal/tree/master/calibresult2) when the resulting images are contained. Also, the intrinsic parameters could be found ing [**Camera_parameters.md**](https://github.com/teriesu/Lab4Signal/blob/master/Camera_parameters.md)
